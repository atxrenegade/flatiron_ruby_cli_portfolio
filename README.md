# WebDevCheatsheets

Welcome to Web Devs Shortcuts and Cheatsheets!

Shortcuts and Cheatsheets is a cli utility gem designed for as a quick reference to a web developer’s most commonly used tools. Think of it as a Swiss army knife for programmers and programming students. With so many languages, commands, shortcuts and tools to memorize, now you can access a quick digital reference without having shuffle through pages of cheatsheets, or drown in stack overflow posts.

Being familiar with shortcuts and important commands speeds up your workflow and increases your productivity as a programmer.

As a Flatiron Student I have chosen to focus on the most commonly used tools in the flatiron stack.
This gem currently includes references for the following:  Atom, Regex, Pry, Git Hub, CLI - bash and windows, Keyboard Shortcuts for Mac and Windows.
