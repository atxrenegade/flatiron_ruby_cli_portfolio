# WebDevCheatsheets

Welcome to LAZY PROGRAMMER's Shortcuts and Cheatsheets!

Shortcuts and Cheatsheets is a cli utility gem designed for as a quick reference to a web developer’s most commonly used tools. Think of it as a Swiss army knife for programmers and programming students. With so many languages, commands, shortcuts and tools to memorize, now you can access a quick digital reference without having shuffle through pages of cheatsheets, or drown in stack overflow posts.

Being familiar with shortcuts and important commands speeds up your workflow and increases your productivity as a programmer.

As a Flatiron Student I have chosen to focus on the most commonly used tools in the flatiron stack.
This gem currently includes references for the following:  Atom, Regex, Pry, Git Hub, CLI - bash and windows, Keyboard Shortcuts for Mac and Windows.

## Usage
This GEM retrieves the MAIN MENU upon execution providing you with a list of shortcuts and cheatsheets you can access through this gem. Once you have selected which topic you would like to explore the internal menu offer the following commands: LIST-ALL, SEARCH, REVERSE-SEARCH, SHORTCUT-OF-THE-DAY, EXIT.

The LIST-ALL command provides just that, a full list of shortcuts or commands for your chosen category.  The handy SEARCH feature allows you to retrieve individual commands and shortcuts quickly and easily,  and the  REVERSE-SEARCH feature allows you to check the result of specific key combinations.  As a bonus feature I’ve also included a SHORTCUT-OF-THE-DAY feature to familiarize noobs with a single randomly chosen shortcut to focus on adding to their toolbox. I do not to include an exhaustive list and instead have chosen but the most commonly used shortcuts and commands to facilitate ease of use.  EXIT takes you back to the MAIN MENU, where you can select a new category, or EXIT again to quit the cli gem entirely.

## Development
